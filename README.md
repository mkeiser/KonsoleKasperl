_A little macOS utility that displays a warning if Console.app is clowning around in the background._


We all know that situation: You are doing something resource intensive, like, say, compiling something with Xcode. But everything seems to go excruciatingly slow today, and you say to yourself: "I should _really_ get a faster machine soon..." But then, haha, it turns out that you just forgot to quit Console.

Well, I've finally had enough and wrote me a utility that displays a notification if Console is running in the background. I hope this will one day save me from a $3000 impulse purchase.
